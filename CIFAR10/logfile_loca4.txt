robust accuracy after SQUARE: 70.64% (total time 37589.9 s)
Warning: Square Attack has decreased the robust accuracy of 1.35%. This might indicate that the robustness evaluation using AutoAttack is unreliable. Consider running Square Attack with more iterations and restarts or an adaptive attack. See flags_doc.md for details.
